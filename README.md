# 📊 Effects of Agricultural Productivity on Poverty Rates in Kenya

## 📘 Abstract
This project investigates the relationship between agricultural productivity and poverty in Kenya. The analysis is grounded in economic theories including the Solow-Swan Growth Model and the Agricultural-Led Growth Hypothesis. Using STATA, we perform regressions, stationarity tests, and diagnostic tests.

## 🎯 Objective
To quantify the effect of agricultural indicators (e.g., yield, land size) on poverty rates using OLS and time series econometrics.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure
